# Summaries Archive

This directory contains archived work summaries and investigation reports that are no longer actively referenced.

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved here when:
- The investigation or work is complete and findings are integrated
- The summary is superseded by newer documentation
- The content is older than 90 days and no longer relevant
