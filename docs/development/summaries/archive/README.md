# Summaries Archive

This directory contains archived work summaries and investigation reports that are no longer actively referenced.

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved here when:
- The investigation or work is complete and findings are integrated
- The summary is superseded by newer documentation
- The content is older than 90 days and no longer relevant

## Archived Documents

<!-- Add entries when archiving, most recent first -->
<!-- Format: - `ARCHIVED-YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md` - Brief reason for archiving -->

- `ARCHIVED-2025-10-14-before-after.md` - Refactor before/after comparison (work complete, references old filenames)
- `ARCHIVED-2025-10-14-summary.md` - Refactor summary (references REFACTOR_PLAN.md and install.new - now obsolete)
- `ARCHIVED-2025-10-14-issues-detail.md` - Detailed GitHub issues analysis (all issues now resolved)
