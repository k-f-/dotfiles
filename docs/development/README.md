# Development Documentation

Planning, analysis, and development-related documentation.

**Note**: Most files in this directory are AI-generated during development and may become outdated as the project evolves.

## Structure

### 📋 Planning (`planning/`)

Future plans, refactoring ideas, and outstanding work.

- **[refactor-plan.md](./planning/refactor-plan.md)** - Plans for future code refactoring
- **[remaining-issues.md](./planning/remaining-issues.md)** - Outstanding issues and TODOs

### 📊 Summaries (`summaries/`)

Analysis and summary documents created during development.

- **[before-after.md](./summaries/before-after.md)** - Before/after comparison of changes
- **[summary.md](./summaries/summary.md)** - General project summary
- **[issues-detail.md](./summaries/issues-detail.md)** - Detailed issue analysis

### 📝 Updates (`updates/`)

Change logs and update summaries.

- **[updates.md](./updates/updates.md)** - Recent updates and changes
- **[cleanup-complete.md](./updates/cleanup-complete.md)** - Repository cleanup summary

## Purpose

This directory serves as a workspace for:
- **Planning**: Documenting future work and refactoring plans
- **Analysis**: AI-generated analysis and summaries during development
- **History**: Tracking what changed and why

## For AI Assistants

When creating development documentation:

1. **Planning docs** → `planning/` - Future work, TODOs, roadmaps
2. **Summary docs** → `summaries/` - Analysis, comparisons, deep dives
3. **Update docs** → `updates/` - Change logs, migration guides, what's new

Use lowercase-with-hyphens for filenames (e.g., `feature-analysis.md`).

## Maintenance

These documents are working files and may become stale. Consider:
- Archiving outdated documents to `archives/` subdirectory
- Removing completed plans from `planning/`
- Consolidating summaries when they proliferate
- Moving important information to user-facing docs in `docs/setup/`
