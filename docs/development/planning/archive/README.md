# Planning Archive

This directory contains archived planning documents that are no longer active.

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved here when:
- The planned work is complete
- The plan has been superseded by a newer approach
- The plan is no longer relevant (>90 days old)

## Archived Documents

<!-- Add entries when archiving, most recent first -->
<!-- Format: - `ARCHIVED-YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md` - Brief reason for archiving -->

- `ARCHIVED-2025-10-14-refactor-plan.md` - All refactor improvements implemented in root install script
- `ARCHIVED-2025-10-14-remaining-issues.md` - All issues completed and resolved

---

**Note:** Active planning documents remain in the parent `planning/` directory.
