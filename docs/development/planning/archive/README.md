# Planning Archive

This directory contains archived planning documents that are no longer active.

## Archive Policy

Documents are moved here when:
- The planned work is complete
- The plan has been superseded by a newer approach
- The plan is no longer relevant (>90 days old)

## Archived Documents

<!-- Add entries when archiving, most recent first -->
<!-- Format: - `ARCHIVED-YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md` - Brief reason for archiving -->
