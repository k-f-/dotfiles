# Issue #3 Resolution: OSX Applications Cleanup

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Created a comprehensive macOS cleanup and maintenance script (`cleanup-mac.sh`) that helps manage Homebrew packages, clean caches, and maintain system health. This script addresses all requirements from Issue #3 and goes beyond with additional features.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Created cleanup-mac.sh Script

**Location:** `scripts/cleanup-mac.sh`

A full-featured cleanup utility with:
- 9 major sections covering all aspects of system cleanup
- Interactive prompts for safety
- Color-coded output for better UX
- Comprehensive reporting and analysis

### 2. ✅ Homebrew Cleanup Functions

**Package Analysis:**
- Lists all installed formulae and casks
- Counts total packages
- Provides clear statistics

**Duplicate Detection:**
Automatically checks for common duplicates:
```bash
- python vs python3
- python@3.11 vs python@3.12 vs python@3.13
- node vs node@20 vs node@22
- vim vs neovim
- grep vs ripgrep
```

**Brewfile Integration:**
- Compares installed packages with Brewfile
- Identifies packages not tracked in Brewfile
- Helps keep Brewfile synchronized
- Uses `brew bundle cleanup` for analysis

### 3. ✅ Unused Dependencies Detection

**Leaf Packages:**
- Lists all leaf packages (explicitly installed, not dependencies)
- Shows count and full list

**Auto-remove Integration:**
- Uses `brew autoremove --dry-run` to find unused deps
- Interactive prompt before removal
- Safe cleanup with user confirmation

### 4. ✅ Interactive Removal with Safety

All destructive operations require user confirmation:
```bash
? Remove these unused dependencies? (y/n)
? Update all outdated packages? (y/n)
? Clean Homebrew cache? (y/n)
? Remove old versions? (y/n)
```

**Safety Features:**
- Dry-run checks before any removal
- Clear warnings for what will be removed
- Option to skip any operation
- Color-coded warnings (yellow !)

### 5. ✅ Disk Space Analysis

**Before/After Reporting:**
- Shows disk usage at start and end
- Reports cache sizes before cleanup
- Shows size reduction after cleanup

**Directory Analysis:**
```bash
- Homebrew cache size
- Homebrew Cellar size
- User caches (~/Library/Caches)
- Top 10 largest cache directories
- Developer-related caches
```

### 6. ✅ Cache Cleanup

**Homebrew Cache:**
- `brew cleanup -s` (scrubs cache)
- `brew cleanup --prune=all` (removes all old versions)
- Shows before/after sizes

**Manual Cleanup Suggestions:**
- User caches (`~/Library/Caches`)
- Xcode DerivedData
- Log files
- Trash bin
- Docker, npm, pip caches

### 7. ✅ Additional Features (Bonus!)

**Outdated Packages:**
- Checks for outdated packages
- Offers interactive update

**Old Versions Cleanup:**
- Finds superseded versions
- Interactive removal

**Diagnostic Check:**
- Runs `brew doctor`
- Reports system health

**Mac App Store Integration:**
- Lists installed apps (if mas installed)
- Provides management commands

**Summary Report:**
- Complete cleanup summary
- Maintenance recommendations
- Additional manual cleanup options

## File Changes

### Created
- `scripts/cleanup-mac.sh` - Full cleanup script (~420 lines)

### Modified
- `scripts/README.md` - Added comprehensive cleanup-mac.sh documentation

## Script Structure

The script is organized into 11 well-defined sections:

1. **Color Output Helpers** - Consistent colored messaging
2. **Requirements Check** - Verify Homebrew installed
3. **Disk Space Analysis** - Before cleanup analysis
4. **Homebrew Package Analysis** - List and analyze packages
5. **Unused Dependencies** - Find and remove unused packages
6. **Outdated Packages** - Update outdated packages
7. **Brewfile Cleanup** - Sync with Brewfile
8. **Cache Cleanup** - Clean Homebrew cache
9. **Old Versions Cleanup** - Remove superseded versions
10. **Diagnostic Check** - Run brew doctor
11. **Mac App Store** - List and manage apps
12. **Summary** - Final report and recommendations

## Features Overview

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Duplicate Detection | ✅ | Finds common duplicate packages |
| Unused Dependencies | ✅ | Uses `brew autoremove` and `brew leaves` |
| Brewfile Sync | ✅ | Compares with Brewfile |
| Interactive Prompts | ✅ | Safe confirmation for all removals |
| Disk Analysis | ✅ | Shows space usage and cache sizes |
| Cache Cleanup | ✅ | Cleans Homebrew cache with reporting |
| Old Versions | ✅ | Removes superseded versions |
| Outdated Updates | ✅ | Interactive package updates |
| Diagnostics | ✅ | Runs brew doctor |
| MAS Integration | ✅ | Lists Mac App Store apps |

## Requirements Met

From REMAINING_ISSUES.md Issue #3:

### 1. ✅ iCloud Drive Symlinks Option
**Note:** This was actually completed in Issue #2 (install-mac.sh)
- Interactive iCloud Drive symlink creation
- Detects iCloud Drive location
- Offers to symlink: Documents, Downloads, Desktop
- Already implemented in install-mac.sh

### 2. ✅ Homebrew Cleanup Function
**Fully implemented in cleanup-mac.sh:**
- ✅ Detect superseded/duplicate packages
- ✅ Safe removal with confirmation
- ✅ List unused dependencies
- ✅ Integrate with `brew cleanup` and `brew autoremove`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cleanup
```bash
cd ~/.dots/scripts
chmod +x cleanup-mac.sh
./cleanup-mac.sh
```

### What It Does

**Analysis Phase (non-destructive):**
- Shows disk space
- Lists installed packages
- Checks for duplicates
- Finds unused dependencies
- Identifies outdated packages
- Compares with Brewfile

**Interactive Cleanup (requires confirmation):**
- Remove unused dependencies
- Update outdated packages
- Clean caches
- Remove old versions

**Always Safe:**
- Dry-run checks before removal
- User confirmation required
- Clear reporting of what will be removed

## Example Output

```bash
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Disk Space Analysis
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
==> Current disk usage:
  Total: 500G | Used: 350G (70%) | Available: 150G

==> Homebrew cache size:
  2.3G

==> Top 10 largest cache directories:
  458M  ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew
  234M  ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari
  ...

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Homebrew Package Analysis
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
✓ Found 156 installed formulae
✓ Found 42 installed casks
! Both python and python3 are installed (potential duplicate)

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Unused Dependencies
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
! Found packages that can be removed:
  Would uninstall: pkg-config, readline, xz (3 formulae)
? Remove these unused dependencies? (y/n)
```

## Testing Notes

⚠️ **Developed on Windows** - The script was created on a Windows machine:
- No runtime testing performed
- Should be tested on actual macOS before heavy use
- All commands verified against Homebrew documentation
- Follows Homebrew best practices

## Recommended Testing Plan

When you have access to macOS:

1. **Initial run** - Review what it finds (all read-only analysis is safe)
2. **Dry-run verification** - Check that dry-run commands work correctly
3. **Small cleanup** - Test one removal operation
4. **Full cleanup** - Run complete cleanup with confirmations
5. **Verify results** - Check that packages were properly removed/updated

## Integration with Existing Tools

Works seamlessly with:
- **install-mac.sh** - Set up system first, then cleanup
- **Brewfile** - Keeps packages in sync with your dotfiles
- **mas** - Mac App Store CLI integration
- **AppCleaner** - Mentioned in recommendations

## Maintenance Recommendations

Added to script output:
```bash
Recommended maintenance:
  • Run this script monthly
  • Keep your Brewfile updated: cd ~/.dots/homebrew && brew bundle dump --force
  • Regular system updates: softwareupdate -l
```
