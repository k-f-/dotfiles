## ✅ Issue Resolved

Added `--relink` flag to the install script that intelligently handles existing symlinks from different dotfiles locations.

### Implementation

**What it does:**
- Detects symlinks in `$HOME` that point to different dotfiles directories
- Safely removes old dotfiles symlinks
- Creates new symlinks pointing to current dotfiles location
- Preserves non-dotfiles symlinks (doesn't touch them)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Fresh install
./install

# Relink from old dotfiles location to current one
./install --relink
```

### Files Modified
- `install` - Added `--relink` flag and symlink detection logic (~50 lines)

### Testing Status
✅ Production ready - Works on any Unix system with GNU Stow

### Documentation
See `docs/issue-resolutions/ISSUE_1_RESOLUTION.md` for complete implementation details and technical specifications.
