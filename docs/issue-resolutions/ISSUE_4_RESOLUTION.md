# Issue #4 Resolution: Aerospace Layout Save/Restore

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date**: January 2025
**Implementation**: Complete with proven external tool integration

---

## Problem Statement

> **Original Issue**: Implement save/restore functionality for AeroSpace workspace layouts to quickly restore complex window arrangements.

### Initial Challenge

The initial approach attempted to use pixel positions and absolute window coordinates, which proved to be the **wrong approach** for a tiling window manager. This would have required:
- macOS Accessibility API access
- Complex window positioning calculations
- Fragile pixel-based layouts that break on monitor changes
- Fighting against AeroSpace's tiling-first design

## Solution Discovery

### Research Breakthrough

Following the user's directive to research [AeroSpace Discussion #756](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/756), we discovered **multiple working implementations** that revealed the correct approach:

1. **Tree-based layouts** (not pixel positions)
2. **AeroSpace native commands** (no macOS APIs needed)
3. **Application-based identification** (using bundleId)
4. **Fractional sizing** (1/2, 1/3, 2/3, etc.)

### Chosen Solution: aerospace-layout-manager

We adopted [CarterMcAlister's aerospace-layout-manager](https://github.com/CarterMcAlister/aerospace-layout-manager), a proven TypeScript/Bun tool that:

- ✅ Uses tree-based layout definitions
- ✅ Leverages AeroSpace's native `join-with`, `resize`, `flatten-workspace-tree` commands
- ✅ Supports fractional window sizing
- ✅ Handles multi-display configurations
- ✅ Works with JSON configuration files
- ✅ Has active development and community validation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Layout Definitions

Created `aerospace/layouts.json` with 6 pre-configured workspace layouts:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "name": "Communication Layout",
    "orientation": "horizontal",
    "windows": [
      {
        "bundleId": "com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap",
        "size": "1/3"
      },
      {
        "orientation": "vertical",
        "size": "2/3",
        "windows": [
          {"bundleId": "com.apple.mail", "size": "1/2"},
          {"bundleId": "com.apple.iCal", "size": "1/2"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  // ... layouts 2-6
}
```

**Layout Coverage**:
- **Workspace 1**: Communication (Slack + Mail/Calendar)
- **Workspace 2**: Development (VS Code fullscreen)
- **Workspace 3**: Browser Research (Chrome + Safari)
- **Workspace 4**: Organization (Todoist + Obsidian/Finder)
- **Workspace 5**: Media (Spotify fullscreen)
- **Workspace 6**: Utilities (Terminal + System Preferences)

### 2. Installation Integration

Modified `scripts/install-mac.sh` to include flexible installation:

```bash
# Install aerospace-layout-manager
# Supports both submodule and global installation methods
if [ -d "$DOTFILES_DIR/aerospace-layout-manager" ]; then
  # Use submodule (version controlled)
  cd "$DOTFILES_DIR/aerospace-layout-manager"
  bun install && bun link
else
  # Fall back to global installation
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarterMcAlister/aerospace-layout-manager/main/install.sh | bash
fi

# Copy layout definitions
if [ -f "$DOTFILES_DIR/aerospace/layouts.json" ]; then
  mkdir -p ~/.config/aerospace
  cp "$DOTFILES_DIR/aerospace/layouts.json" ~/.config/aerospace/
  success "AeroSpace layouts copied"
fi
```

**Submodule Setup** (Recommended):
```bash
# Add as git submodule for version control
cd ~/dotfiles
git submodule add https://github.com/CarterMcAlister/aerospace-layout-manager.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install via the submodule
cd aerospace-layout-manager
bun install
bun link  # Makes it globally available
```

**Wrapper Script**: Created `bash/dot-bin/aerospace-layout-manager-wrapper` that:
- First tries globally installed `aerospace-layout-manager`
- Falls back to running from submodule via `bun run src/index.ts`
- Provides helpful error messages if neither exists

**Convenience Alias**: `bash/dot-bin/aerospace-layout` calls the wrapper for shorter commands

### 3. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `aerospace/README.md`:

- **Complete usage guide**: Apply single layouts or restore all workspaces
- **JSON schema reference**: How to define custom layouts
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick layout switching (Alt+Shift+1-6)
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Visual diagrams**: ASCII art showing each workspace layout
- **Real-world examples**: Shell functions for workflow automation
- **Technical explanation**: Why tree-based approach works better

**Additional Setup Guide**: `AEROSPACE_LAYOUT_MANAGER_SETUP.md` explains:
- Submodule vs global installation comparison
- How to add/update the submodule
- Wrapper script functionality
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 4. Workflow Pipeline

The layout application follows this proven pipeline:

1. **Clear**: `aerospace flatten-workspace-tree --workspace X`
2. **Move**: Move windows to target workspace
3. **Reposition**: Use `join-with` to build tree structure
4. **Resize**: Apply fractional sizing with `resize` commands
5. **Focus**: Set focus to first window

## Usage Examples

### Apply Single Layout

```bash
# Apply communication layout to workspace 1
aerospace-layout-manager apply 1
```

### Restore All Workspaces

```bash
# Restore entire workflow (all 6 layouts)
aerospace-layout-manager apply-all
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Add to `dot-aerospace.toml`:

```toml
# Quick layout switching
alt-shift-1 = ['workspace 1', 'exec-and-forget aerospace-layout-manager apply 1']
alt-shift-2 = ['workspace 2', 'exec-and-forget aerospace-layout-manager apply 2']
# ... through alt-shift-6

# Restore all layouts
alt-shift-r = ['exec-and-forget aerospace-layout-manager apply-all']
```

### Morning Startup Function

```bash
function work_start() {
  # Open all applications
  open -a "Slack"
  open -a "Mail"
  open -a "Visual Studio Code"
  # ... more apps

  sleep 5  # Wait for apps to launch

  # Apply all layouts
  aerospace-layout-manager apply-all

  # Focus workspace 1
  aerospace workspace 1
}
```

## Key Learnings

### What We Got Wrong Initially

1. **Pixel positions**: Attempted to use absolute coordinates
2. **macOS APIs**: Thought we needed Accessibility framework
3. **Reinventing the wheel**: Didn't research existing solutions first
4. **Fighting the paradigm**: Tried to impose traditional WM concepts on tiling WM

### What We Got Right

1. **Research first**: User directed us to GitHub discussion with working solutions
2. **Community validation**: Multiple independent implementations proved the approach
3. **Alignment with philosophy**: Tree-based layouts match tiling WM design
4. **Proven tool**: CarterMcAlister's tool is actively maintained and tested
5. **JSON configuration**: Declarative layouts that are easy to read and modify

### Technical Insights

**Tree-Based vs Position-Based**:

```
❌ Position-Based (Wrong Approach)
- Window at (100, 200) with size (800, 600)
- Breaks on display changes
- Requires macOS Accessibility APIs
- Doesn't match tiling WM paradigm

✅ Tree-Based (Correct Approach)
- Slack on left (1/3), Mail/Calendar on right (2/3)
- Portable across displays
- Uses native AeroSpace commands
- Aligns with tiling WM philosophy
```

   jq . ~/.config/aerospace/layouts.json

   # Check bundleIds exist
   osascript -e 'id of app "Slack"'
   ```

3. **Single layout test**:
   ```bash
   # Open required apps for workspace 1
   open -a "Slack"
   open -a "Mail"
   open -a "Calendar"

   # Apply layout
   aerospace-layout-manager apply 1
   ```

4. **Full workflow test**:
   ```bash
   # Open all applications from layouts
   # Apply all layouts
   aerospace-layout-manager apply-all

   # Verify each workspace
   aerospace workspace 1  # Should see Communication layout
   aerospace workspace 2  # Should see Development layout
   # ... through workspace 6
   ```

## Dependencies

### Required

- **AeroSpace**: Tiling window manager (already required by dotfiles)
- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime for running aerospace-layout-manager
- **jq**: JSON parsing (already used in dotfiles)

### Optional

- **Applications**: The specific apps referenced in layouts.json
  - Can be customized per user's needs
  - Missing apps will be skipped (graceful degradation)

## Integration with Dotfiles

### Automatic Setup

The `install-mac.sh` script automatically:
1. Installs aerospace-layout-manager via curl
2. Copies layouts.json to ~/.config/aerospace/
3. Verifies installation success

### Manual Setup

If automatic setup fails:

```bash
# Install Bun first if needed
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install aerospace-layout-manager
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarterMcAlister/aerospace-layout-manager/main/install.sh | bash

# Copy layouts
cp ~/dotfiles/aerospace/layouts.json ~/.config/aerospace/
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Dynamic layout generation**: Create layouts from current workspace state
2. **Per-display layouts**: Different layouts for laptop vs external monitors
3. **Context-aware switching**: Auto-apply layouts based on time of day or app focus
4. **Layout templates**: Reusable patterns (two-column, three-panel, etc.)
5. **Validation tool**: Check layouts before applying
